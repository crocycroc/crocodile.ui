# crocodile.ui
A Canvas UI library with Hybrid DOM element integration.

The goals for crocodile.ui are to provide rich application experiances for web application written in HTML and Javascript, provide app like look and feel capabilities through the browser and also to keep total size of the library as small as possible so that it's optimal to be integrated into embedded solutions with very tight memory constraints (<1MB for complete application).
